As a user, I want the option to set a password for protected PDF documents, allowing me to enter the password in the appropriate field and reload the document for rotation.
As a user, I want to choose the degrees for clockwise rotation when applying this operation to the entire document.
"As a user, I want to specify which pages to rotate, giving me the option to choose ""All,"" ""Even,"" or ""Odd"" pages for rotation. This provides flexibility in the rotation process."
As a user, I want to select the destination folder for the rotated output files. I should be able to choose whether the system creates output files by default in the same folder as one of the imported files. Additionally, I want the option to compress the output files and specify the PDF version for the generated documents.
As a user, I want to define a pattern for generating filenames for the rotated output files. This pattern should include various complex prefixes, as mentioned in section 1 of the document.
"As a user, I want to initiate the rotation process by clicking a ""RUN"" button after configuring all the parameters. This should start the rotation of the selected documents according to the specified settings."
As a user, I want to be aware that the system requires a PDF version of 1.5 or above for compressing the output files to function properly.
As a user, I want to know that the system allows using a unique [FILENUMBER] prefix with a maximum of 10 digits for generating filenames. This limitation ensures that the output filenames are manageable.
